# My-virtual-assistant-Sofia
This is a simple virtual assistant which can be used to perform different tasks. It is still able to do some simple tasks, I am looking forward to make it bigger in future. My virtual assistant Sofia can tell her name, current time, search in google, play any videos on youtube and provide information about a topic from wikipedia.
Python **version 3.8** has been used here. I used **PyCharm** as my code editor.
I used the following libraries to build this simple virtual assistant:
1. **speech_recognition**
2. **pyttsx3**
3. **pywhatkit**
4. **datetime**
5. **wikipedia**
