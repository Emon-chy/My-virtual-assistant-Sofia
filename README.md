# My-virtual-assistant-Sofia
This is a simple virtual assistant which can be used to make it more efficient to do different task later. My virtual assistant Sofia can tell her name, current time, search in google, play any videos on youtube and provide information about a topic from wikipedia.
Python **version 3.8** has been used here. I used **PyCharm** as my code editor.
I used the following libraries to build this simple virtual assistant:
1. **speech_recognition**
2. **pyttsx3**
3. **pywhatkit**
4. **datetime**
5. **wikipedia**
